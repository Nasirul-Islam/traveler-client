            "description": "Lanterns were on every street, and Parisians were asked to light their windows with oil lamps and candles. This was to prevent law offenders from avoiding the police or hiding in dark alleys. The idea was to reduce the crime rate. That time forward, Paris gained the name La Ville-Lumière (the City of Light). Paris was the first European city to introduce street lighting back in 1889. We're over 100 years down the line and Paris still upholds her reputation of lighting up Europe. In addition to the Eiffel Tower, Paris has countless other gorgeous landmarks and monuments that add to the beauty of the spacious boulevards and their charming cafés. French cuisine is also world famous, and you can find some of the best of it in Paris.",
